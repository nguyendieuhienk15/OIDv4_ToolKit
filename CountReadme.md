## Counting images
To count the number of images from the validation set that contains Apples, use the following command:
  ```bash
   python3 count.py count --classes Apple --type_csv validation
   ```
And to count all the classes from the hierarchy, use the following command:
  ```bash
   python3 count.py count_all --type_csv validation
   ```
